        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Michael Hart and I'm a student at Clark College located
          in Vancouver, Washington. I'm currently enrolled in the Web Development program and will graduate in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have taken several courses at Clark or at another school that I
          really enjoyed. Here are my favorite three:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP with SQL I</li>
          <li>Web Interface Design I</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          There are several things that I like to do outside of school. Some of
          these include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Playing and Composing Music (Piano and Guitar)</li>
          <li>Solving difficult problems (code, math, and etc)</li>
          <li>Fixing Things</li>
          <li>Designing and building my own special tools and equipment, as needed</li>
          <li>Learning new (and preferably challenging) things</li>
          <li>Martial Arts</li>
          <li>Debating and Discussing Complex Issues (Small talk bores me - sorry not sorry)</li>
        </ol>
